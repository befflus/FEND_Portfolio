# Frontend Nano Degree: Make a Portfolio project

### Project Overview


For this project i have built a portfolio website. I was provided a design mockup as a PDF-file and i have replicated that design in HTML and CSS. 
I have developed a responsive website that displays images, descriptions and links to other projects completed through courses of the Nanodegree program. 
I was also allowed to personalize this project.
